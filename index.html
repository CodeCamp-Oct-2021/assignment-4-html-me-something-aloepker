	<main> The technological revolution, and most notably the internet, has caused a massive avalanche of marketplace
       globalization over just the course of most of our lifetimes! Innovation and business have been known to go hand in hand, 
       but with our most recent advancements the opportunities are greater than ever for almost anyone to have access to a global audience.
       	To me, there are a few specific milestones that have stood out as far as paving the way for the rest.
    Music has always been a big part of my life. I turned twelve in the year two thousand, and in many places the internet was starting to become more commonplace in places called internet cafés, as well as some schools and even the home.
     The mp3 audio file was just coming into existence, and shortly following it were ways to get them like Napster and Kazaa. 
     I remember the excitement I would feel being able to listen to and download songs that I would have otherwise never heard and even heard of and then be able to burn them to cd’s for me or my friends or eventually, put them on my iPod. 
     Digital media laws however, are no longer in their infancy; copyright friendly alternatives such as Apple music, Sound cloud, Spotify, and Pandora have been some of the newest waves in this ever-rising tide. 
     The digital music revolution also sparked one of the next major milestones, which is the Death of the Brick-and-mortar retail stores. 
     With music went movies, stores like Blockbuster and Family Video became Netflix and Hulu and the term late fee no longer made sense in this context. 
     For the first time, just last year, we have seen the online merchant logistic network Amazon outsell former giant Walmart (Porterfield 8/17/2021). 
     This to me is a sign of an effective global supply chain and a well designed plan. Used items can near effortlessly be transferred across the country with the help of tools like Craigslist and Facebook marketplace, the evolutions of the good old fashioned yard sale. 
     Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin &#8383 are now a real staple in the currency realm next to the dollar, yen, peso, you name it. More and more financial institutes are embracing this renaissance of currency  El Salvador has even just placed Bitcoin along side the dollar as its official currency starting earlier this month. (Bambysheva 9/13/2021) I bought dollars in bitcoin last year when the market value was at ten thousand, and sold my shitoshi when the market hit twenty thousand, excited to have doubled my money at the time. Seeing the market today I perhaps should have stayed in longer, c’est la vie. And of course, with covid19 and the rise of social distancing, we have seen the rise of the virtual video conference. Zoom and Teams do well at bringing a more stable group interactive dynamic to other younger video chatting services like Skype, although to me at least, it still feels weird trusting a doctors appointment completely over video chat. Regardless, that just may be the future of medicine once they iron the wrinkles out. Personally, I really have found the use of online webcam style classrooms quite helpful to my style of learning. As I can be quite distracted by my peers, this seems to allow me to have a more direct focus on my professor and the course material. While this technology has a few areas of improvements needed, it has been more than proven that business meetings can be conducted form anywhere in the world, so long as the internet connection will maintain that is.
	It is my belief that wealth of friends and finances is much more accessible with our new levels of accessible information, utilities, and overall connectedness. I believe that the future will continue to be more and more digital in a lot of ways, and I think ultimately, we need to embrace it. Technology has been developing with our ways of life as a way to improve upon the status quo, I think it is highly likely that the next big innovations in technology will stem from ways in which we are incorporating it into our lives today and the problems we will solve becoming a more globalized society.
	What I want people to take from all of this, is that the opportunities are greater than ever to be connected to a larger pat of the world. Whatever your business or interest is, there is more opportunity for success in the marketplace than ever before, as well as more opportunities for innovation becoming ever present. From Facebook to Etsy, Redbubbble to Sound cloud, YouTube to Twitch, the platforms are fundamentally stabilized to showcase to a world audience like never before. It is up to you to figure out what options work with you and your audience the best, but technology is only moving forward, so car pe diem!
